# PV Heating Rod Automation Blueprint for Home Assistant

This blueprint controls up to three heating rods based on photovoltaic (PV) surplus and the battery state of charge (SOC).

## ðŸ“‹ About This Blueprint

This automation switches heating rods according to predefined PV surplus thresholds and the battery SOC.  
It uses a **stage-based control logic**, where each stage activates specific combinations of heating rods according to the available PV surplus.

### ðŸ”¥ Stage Table (Heating Rod Combination per Stage)

| Stage (kW) | Heating Rod 1 (1â€¯kW) | Heating Rod 2 (2â€¯kW) | Heating Rod 3 (3â€¯kW) | Total Power |
|------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| 0          | OFF                  | OFF                  | OFF                  | 0 kW        |
| 1          | ON                   | OFF                  | OFF                  | 1 kW        |
| 2          | OFF                  | ON                   | OFF                  | 2 kW        |
| 3          | OFF                  | OFF                  | ON                   | 3 kW        |
| 4          | ON                   | OFF                  | ON                   | 4 kW        |
| 5          | OFF                  | ON                   | ON                   | 5 kW        |
| 6          | ON                   | ON                   | ON                   | 6 kW        |

Each stage is triggered by a configurable PV surplus threshold (in watts).  
The heating rods are switched automatically according to the table above.

## ðŸ”§ Usage Instructions

1. Copy this folder into your Home Assistant configuration directory:
```
/config/blueprints/automation/pv_heating_rod_custom_stages/
```

2. In Home Assistant:
   - Navigate to **Settings â†’ Automations & Scenes â†’ Blueprints â†’ Import Blueprint**
   - Select the blueprint from the local directory.

3. Configure the automation:
   - Select your PV surplus sensor and battery SOC sensor.
   - Set the minimum PV surplus thresholds for each stage.
   - Set the minimum battery SOC required for operation.
   - Assign the switches controlling each heating rod.
