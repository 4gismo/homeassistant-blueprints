# PV Heating Rod Automation Blueprint for Home Assistant

This repository contains a Home Assistant automation blueprint for controlling heating rods based on photovoltaic (PV) surplus power and the battery state of charge (SOC).

---

## ðŸ“‹ About This Blueprint

This automation automatically switches up to **three heating rods** according to the available PV surplus and the battery SOC.  
It also uses **delays** between switching actions to avoid sudden power spikes.

**Key Features:**
- Automatically adjusts heating rod power levels based on PV surplus
- Only activates heating rods when the battery SOC exceeds a defined limit
- Supports three independent heating rods (1 kW, 2 kW, 3 kW)
- Customizable thresholds for each rod
- Includes automatic step-down and shutdown logic

## ðŸ”§ Usage Instructions

1. Copy this folder into your Home Assistant configuration directory:
```
/config/blueprints/automation/pv_heating_rod/
```

2. In Home Assistant:
   - Navigate to **Settings â†’ Automations & Scenes â†’ Blueprints â†’ Import Blueprint**
   - Select the blueprint from the local directory.

3. Configure the automation:
   - Select your PV surplus sensor and battery SOC sensor.
   - Set the minimum surplus thresholds for each heating rod.
   - Set the minimum battery SOC required for operation.
   - Assign the switches controlling each heating rod.
